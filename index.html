        I recently graduated from a double Master Degree « Research Focus, applied economics » in Bocconi and UCL. I am highly interested in technology and growing digitalization and I believe that coding is the most resourceful way to bring ideas to life. I am highly motivated in learning the <strong> key capabilities </strong> to realize my own projects and further develop my entrepreneurial ideas.
